# New-York-City-Yellow-Taxi-Time-Series-Analysis

In this project, I looked at NYC Taxi data to come up with a prediction for the year 2016. I started with doing some exploratory data analysis of the data to come up with some hidden insights in gigabytes of data. I plotted time series graph of daily taxi data from 2009-2015 and then also compared the pick-up and drop off location in New York City.


Then, I did time series forecasting by using appropriate model for the dataset. The only limitation of this was that the resources available to me was not enough to go into detailed analysis of the data. Given an opportunity, I would like to divulge deeper into this dataset to come up with even more finding such as which location/ area will have how many pick-ups on a given day
